Description: This final project will be a slideshow in a similar fassion to the Aurora Lab a couple of weeks ago. This one will be a sequence of images that simulate a fight between two martial artists fading either in and out from whites in between or between each other.
Features: Click to switch to the next image, fading to white, then the next image. I will also add a score board for each hit that lands. 
Challenges: Challenges I may or likely will encounter is the use of the fade in/out technique as I have not peronally dealt with the technique myself as of yet. And the mouse click adding the score. I have dealt with KEYDOWN, but not a mouse click.
Outcome: When I'm done with this project, the main thing I want is for my slideshow to smoothly transition from the fade in/out technique and the images show in good quality. The first thing I'd like to make a priority is the images transitioning properly, then the score board.
Milestones:
