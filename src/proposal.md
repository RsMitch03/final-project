Description: This final project will be a slideshow in a similar fassion to the Aurora Lab a couple of weeks ago. This one will be a sequence of images that simulate a fight between a martial artist and a punching bag fading either in and out from whites in between or between each other.

Features: Click to switch to the next image, fading to white, then the next image. 

Challenges: Challenges I may or likely will encounter is the use of the fade in/out technique as I have not peronally dealt with the technique myself as of yet. 

Outcome: When I'm done with this project, the main thing I want is for my slideshow to smoothly transition from the fade in/out technique and the images show in good quality. The first thing I'd like to make a priority is the images transitioning properly.
Milestones: 
    Week 1: 
        resize the images
        implement a fade in to white
    Week 2:
        fade out of white to the next image
        add the mosue click to go through the fade in/out
    Week 3: 
        sequence the images and fade in/out
